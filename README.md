### Introduction
For my Milestone Project 1 i have decided to create a three page, front end site for a fictitious Gym that has affiliations with the local Cricket team.
The purpose of the site is to attract new members to sign up to the Gym classes or show interest in joining the cricket team.

### General Info
This site will be strcuturally built using HTML and CSS.  Provisionally i aim to only use bootstrap for additional features as necessary.
* **Page 1 - Index page** - detailing some benefits to going to the gym and training with the team.
* **Page 2 - Class Schedule** - book gym classes throughout the week.
* **Page 3 - Contact team** - submit details for registering interest in the senior cricket team or showing interest in registering interest in the allstars under 11's programme.
