# Mile Stone Project 1 - JC's Gym

For my Milestone Project 1 I have decided to create a three page, front end site for a fictitious Gym that has affiliations with the local Cricket team.

JC's Gym is a located in a rural village in East Riding of Yorkshire on the same premises os the local village Cricket team.  It provides members with fitness classes and access to gym equipment.

The purpose of the site is to attract new members to sign up to the Gym classes or show interest in joining the cricket team.
